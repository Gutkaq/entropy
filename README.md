ðŸŒ€ entropy_hpc - Gaussian Integers Go BRRRR

    Because real numbers are for cowards and scalar code is a war crime

Blazingly fastâ„¢ Gaussian integers (â„¤[i]) with SIMD acceleration. We made imaginary math 20% faster. Your move, physicists.
What Even Is This?

Complex numbers but both parts are integers. So instead of boring 5, you get C O O L numbers like 5 + 3i. Euclidean division? GCD? Extended GCD? We got it all baby.
Quick Start

rust
use entropy_hpc::ZInt;

let a = ZInt::new(3, 4);  // 3 + 4i
let b = ZInt::new(5, 12); // 5 + 12i
let product = a * b;      // -33 + 56i (wait what)

// Division with remainder but make it âœ¨complexâœ¨
let (q, r) = a.div_rem(b).unwrap();

// GCD because mathematicians have too much free time
let gcd = ZInt::gcd(a, b);

// SIMD MODE: Process 4 at once
let results = simd_engine::mul_batch(&[a,b,a,b], &[b,a,b,a]);

Features That Slap

    âœ… Euclidean Division - Yes, you can divide imaginary numbers

    âœ… GCD & Extended GCD - Find GCDs and BÃ©zout coefficients because we're extra

    âœ… AVX2 SIMD - 1.2x faster than scalar (20% speed boost!)

    âœ… Actually Correct - 27 tests, 1000+ random cases, 0 failures

    âœ… Runtime CPU Detection - Falls back to scalar if your CPU is from 2010

Math Stuff (For Nerds)

Gaussian integers are a Euclidean domain with norm N(a+bi) = aÂ²+bÂ². They have units {1, -1, i, -i} and support:

    Euclidean algorithm (the OG from 300 BC)

    BÃ©zout's identity: gcd(a,b) = sa + tb (up to units because nothing is simple)

    Unique factorization (mostly)

Testing

bash
cargo test --release -- --nocapture

Watch 27 tests pass and feel superior.
Roadmap

    Make it work

    Make it fast

    Make it correct

    Make it FASTER (always)

    ARM NEON support

    World domination
